map_plot
========
This is a map plot, that contains 6 points/locations I selected 

*stored them in a Mysql database with the fields id, latitude,longitude,title and content(the popups html) 

*created a php script that fetches those those points from the database 

*programatically created a google map using javascript 

*used ajax in my javascript to get those locations from the php script 

*added markers on the map to represent each of those points based on their latitude and longitude obtained from the database 

*made them clickable so that they can show some pop ups that give more info about each location. 

*the map supports panning and zooming.
